# Mutt Configuration Files

## Overview

I still love using command line based tools.  I especially like using Mutt
for reading mail.

## Customization

I have a top level _muttrc_ file usually named _muttrc-personal_.  This
contains the configuration for my home e-mail setup.  I typically also
create a second _muttrc_ file which I use for work related email.

All of the top level _muttrc_ files that I have include generic Mutt
configuration files which I use to setup the Mutt look and feel that I
like.  This allows me to flip in different configurations easily,
especially if I want different environment for home or work.
